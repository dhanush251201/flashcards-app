# Prompt

You are a coding assistant helping me build a flashcard application. I want you to go through the file structure to see the layout of the folders. After which you should go through the README.md file. It contains the specifications of the Web application. Use that as the template and reference to build the application for me. The basic instructions are that you should create a react based frontend with tailwind CSS for styling, FastAPI (python) for the backend and Posgress for DB. Also use docker-compose to containerize it.  Make the UI intuitive, modern and easy to use. Add a light mode/dark mode switch too. Ensure the web pages are all mobile responsive. Use all coding best practices to implement the application. Iteratively improve it till you see something that is a good fit to the README spec.
